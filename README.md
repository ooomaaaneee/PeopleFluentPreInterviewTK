About the Project:  
The primary class related to this project is the ShoppingCart class.  
The Product Catalog is initialized in the ShoppingCart class.  
Also, we have the provision to enable or disable offers while initializing the Product Catalog.  
  
The functionality is implemented in the checkout method as per the required specifications.  
The checkout method takes the input of products as a String array e.g. {"Apple", "Orange", "Orange"}  
  
The required unit tests have been written in the ShoppingCartTest class.  
  
Also, a ShoppingCartMain class is provided to test the functionality by providing the products as program arguments.    
  
Kindly Note:   
The functionality is mostly written utilizing Java 7 features.  
I am working on honing my skills with Java 8 features and functional programming.
